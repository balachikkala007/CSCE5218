        "t's possible to achieve higher accuracy than 80.0 with additional hyperparameters, but there are no guarantees. The accuracy of a perceptron depends on several factors, including the quality and size of the training data, the complexity of the problem, the learning rate, and the number of epochs. Optimizing hyperparameters may lead to improved accuracy, but it requires careful experimentation and tuning."

        "No, it is not always efficient to train a perceptron for further epochs without taking other hyperparameters into account. More epochs of training can enhance performance, but it can also cause overfitting, when the perceptron becomes overly specialized to the training data and struggles on fresh, untrained input. Dependent on the task, data, and other hyperparameters, the ideal number of epochs is determined. It's critical to keep an eye on the training and validation errors and to halt training as soon as the perceptron exhibits signs of overfitting."
